FFmpeg.exe and FFprobe.exe are required.
* Find the example Binaries folder.
* Go to https://github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg/releases
* Choose the "Essentials" build. e.g. ffmpeg-5.1.2-essentials_build.zip and download the archive.
* Unzip the archive and copy bin\FFmpeg.exe and bin\FFprobe.exe to : &nbsp;DATA\FFMPEG
* Copy the entire DATA folder to the folder containing the executable file.\
This may be, for example, "..\x64\Release".

After the program has started, you can "drag and drop" to load different movie files.
You can also start from a command line. See "\DATA\Scripts\readme.md.
